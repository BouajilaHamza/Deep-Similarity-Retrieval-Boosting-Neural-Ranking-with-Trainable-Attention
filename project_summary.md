# Research Project Setup and Testing Summary

This document summarizes the current setup of the research project for benchmarking the proposed attention-based retriever against existing methods. It outlines the project structure, the implemented models, and confirms the successful execution of unit tests.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
attention_retriever_project/
├── src/
│   ├── attention_retriever.py
│   ├── baselines.py
│   ├── run_experiments.py
│   └── test_models.py
└── project_summary.md
```

*   `attention_retriever.py`: Contains the implementation of the proposed attention-based trainable similarity functions (Equation 1 and Equation 2 from your paper).
*   `baselines.py`: Contains implementations of baseline retrieval methods, specifically cosine similarity and dot product. A placeholder for BM25 is also included, noting that a full BM25 implementation would require text data and a dedicated library.
*   `run_experiments.py`: This script is designed to facilitate the benchmarking process. It integrates with the BEIR framework to load datasets, encode queries and documents using a pre-trained Sentence-BERT model (`msmarco-distilbert-base-v4`), and then applies the implemented retrieval models (attention-based and baselines) to compute similarity scores. It is set up to output results in a format compatible with BEIR's evaluation metrics.
*   `test_models.py`: Contains unit tests to verify the correctness and expected behavior of the `AttentionBasedRetriever` and `BaselineRetrievers` classes.
*   `project_summary.md`: This document, summarizing the project.

## Implemented Models

### Attention-Based Retriever

The `attention_retriever.py` file implements two versions of your proposed trainable similarity function:

1.  **Equation 1 (Simple Bilinear Similarity):** `sim(q, d) = σ(qᵀ M d + b)`
    This model learns a transformation matrix `M` and a bias `b` to compute similarity between query (`q`) and document (`d`) embeddings.

2.  **Equation 2 (Extended Non-linear Similarity):** `sim(q, d) = σ(W₂ φ(W₁ [q; d; q ◦ d]) + b)`
    This extended version uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a non-linear activation function (`φ`) to capture more complex interactions between the concatenated query, document, and their element-wise product.

Both implementations are built using PyTorch and are designed to operate on batched input embeddings.

### Baseline Retrievers

The `baselines.py` file includes:

*   **Cosine Similarity:** Computes the cosine similarity between query and document embeddings. This is a common and effective dense retrieval baseline.
*   **Dot Product:** Computes the dot product between query and document embeddings, another fundamental dense retrieval baseline.
*   **BM25 (Conceptual Placeholder):** A conceptual representation for BM25, acknowledging that a full implementation would involve text processing and a dedicated library like `rank_bm25`.

## Unit Test Results

Unit tests were developed and executed to ensure the core functionality of the `AttentionBasedRetriever` and `BaselineRetrievers` classes. The `test_models.py` script verifies:

*   **Output Shapes:** Ensures that the similarity functions return scores with the expected dimensions for both single and batched inputs.
*   **Output Ranges:** For the attention-based retriever, it checks that the sigmoid activation produces scores within the [0, 1] range. For cosine similarity, it verifies scores are within [-1, 1].
*   **Basic Functionality:** Confirms that the models can process inputs without errors.

All unit tests passed successfully, indicating that the implemented models are functioning as expected. The output from the test run is as follows:

```
....BM25 retriever requires text data and a corpus. This is a placeholder.
....

Ran 8 tests in 1.049s
OK
```

This confirms that the foundational components of your research project are correctly implemented and ready for further experimentation and evaluation using the `run_experiments.py` script. You can now proceed to run the full benchmarking experiments on your chosen BEIR datasets.
